## CSS stylesheets

- Change the default colour for links
- Change the default visited colour of links
- add a "css reset" globally to remove padding and set the box-sizing for all elements to "border-box"

Extension

- Import a font from google fonts
- Apply this font to your site globally (what existing file might this want to go in?)

## Inline styling

In the App.js

- In the App add an inline style to centre the title (h1)

In the Home folder

- Create a javascript file called HomeStyles
- Within this file create an object called HomeStyles
  - the keys you create should match the name of the element you'd like to style
  - and the values should be style objects that use the same syntax for inline styles
- import this file into Home.js
- use object notation to add the inline styles from the imported file

## Styled components

- Import styled components into your Navigation.js file
- In the navigation component use styled components to
  - style the container
  - style each link in your nav differently

## CSS Modules

- create an about css module in the About folder
- create some style declarations for the About component
- import your styles into the About component
- apply styling to relevant jsx elements
- Extension: create a media query and/or css transition for the react logo

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
